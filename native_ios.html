<p><h5>USA.gov</h5>The USA.gov iOS mobile application allows you to:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Search tens of millions of web pages from federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments and to contact your government by phone or email.</li>
<li>Find quality images from U.S. government web sites</li>
<li>Search product recalls across several government agencies</li>
<li>Visit the USA.gov blog</li>
<li>Contact USA.gov</li>
</ul>
By releasing the source code for this app we hope to empower other governments and organizations to build and release mobile apps to engage the general public and their own specific constituencies. In addition, public review and contribution to the application's code base will help strengthen and improve the app.

<p><h5>StrategyTrackeriPad</h5>This is a sample project using the API SDK for iOS that demonstrates how it can be used for non-DOL APIs. This universal (iPhone & iPad) app displays a list of agencies provided by a GSA-owned web service that the user can then select to view that agency's progress with the digital strategy. Currently, the only agency list available is a list of all agencies, regardless of whether they're reporting progress on the federal digital strategy (some are agencies within a cabinet department).<br>
