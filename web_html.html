<h3><a hame="complete"></a>Complete Apps</h3>
<p><a name="SNAPfinder"></a><h5>SNAPfinder</h5>SNAPfinder is a mobile-first app for locating retailers that participate in the SNAP (formerly known as Food Stamps) program. It uses data provided by the USDA and imported daily into a MongoDB database to return nearby retailers for a given address, region, or geographic area in U.S. This project depends on two other open source projects: snapfinder-lib and snapfinder-api, which together provide the support for the cloud-hosted REST API this app uses. In addition to using this app, the REST API is available to developers to build their own SNAP applications.
<br>
SNAPfinder is developed as a collaboration between the GSA and the private sector, sponsored by ITSource Technology Inc., as an Open Source project in support of the Federal Government's commitment to Open Data.
<br>
This app is composed of three separate open source projects hosted on GitHub:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonypujals/snapfinder">snapfinder</a>&nbsp;- a mobile-first web app that uses the API (Node, Express, EJS, Bootstrap 3)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonypujals/snapfinder-api">snapfinder-api</a>&nbsp;- REST API for querying SNAP data (Node, Express)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tonypujals/snapfinder-lib">snapfinder-lib</a>&nbsp;- provides underlying framework for importing and querying SNAP data (Node, MongoDB)</li>
</ul>
